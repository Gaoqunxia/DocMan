Snoring is a problem prevalent in every household. 
The underlying cause of snoring can be so harmful that it has the potential to affect your entire body. If proper care and medication is not taken, it may even lead to death.                                                                                                      
The problem behind snoring is, the person who snores doesnâ€™t know about it. It just goes unnoticed. Who knew that different factors like how loud you snore, how many times you wake up in the middle of the night, how many times you are short of breath, etc. could make a huge difference to your body. Statistics indicate that the majority of the times snoring is a symptom of an underlying disease called obstructive sleep apnea (OSA).
